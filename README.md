# openblog

A blog that hosts its posts and comments as Github Issues.

[Visit this page](https://mateogianolio.com/openblog/setup.html) and enter your github credentials to automatically fork the repository, create a personal access token and push that access token to the `js/globals.js` file in your fork.

All you have to do after that is to enable issues on your fork and start writing posts!
